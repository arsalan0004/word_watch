**Extreme power efficiency** every level of the word watch’s design was built with power efficiency in mind.
 The green LEDs were picked not only for their elegant look, but also because they are extremely energy efficient.
 The use of onboard chips was minimized, and the CPU sleeps when not in use. As a result, the expected life
 expectancy of the single CR2032 that powers this watch is about 2 years. For more on energy-saving techniques
 used in this design, please scroll down to the engineering considerations section.
